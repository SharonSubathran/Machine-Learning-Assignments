Problem: To implement the K means clustering algorithm on the simplified Iris dataset.
Solution: MATLAB code that implements K means clustering algorithm, creates 2 clusters and plots them along with their centroid. It also finds the number of iterations required for the algorithm to converge.
Required: To import simple_iris_dataset.dat into the MATLAB workspace.
